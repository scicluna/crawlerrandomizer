**Origin Story:**
Before 'The Crawl', this individual was a professional free runner who performed in urban environments and competed in parkour competitions around the world.
**Journey So Far:**
Since stepping foot into the bizarre labyrinth of 'The Crawl', our Parkour Paladin has deftly navigated the first floor's treacherous terrain, using their agility to avoid deadly traps and their parkour skills to evade the grotesque hybrid creatures. They've faced rooms where the gravity shifts without warning and corridors that loop back on themselves in impossible ways. The Paladin has formed temporary alliances with other crawlers, though trust is a rare commodity in such a twisted game. Their most harrowing challenge was a battle against an orc-goblin fusion that could meld into stone—it took all their cunning and a well-timed leap to land the finishing blow.
**Twist:**
Unknown to others, the Parkour Paladin carries a relic from their pre-Crawl life—a small, unassuming locket that holds a picture of their lost loved one. This locket inexplicably glows when certain creatures are near, suggesting a deeper connection between the Paladin's past and the dungeon's enigmatic nature.
